# -6-DOF-Robotic-Arm-for-Spoon-and-Fork-Pick-Up
This project features a 6-axis robotic arm that uses a custom-trained VGG19 model for spoon and fork classification. Images are processed on a Raspberry Pi, and the robotic arm is controlled by an Arduino with PCA9685 servo drivers for precise movement, enabling efficient utensil sorting through deep learning and robotics integration.
